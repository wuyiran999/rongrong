1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,234
Add a 360 Image to Hotspot

2
00:00:01,234 --> 00:00:03,169
First, create a hotspot area and click “360-Degree Image Viewer” on the left

3
00:00:03,169 --> 00:00:06,106
Return to the main menu and click “Media Library”

4
00:00:06,106 --> 00:00:16,483
Select “360 Photos” and add a 360 image from your computer

5
00:00:16,483 --> 00:00:18,284
Now return to the ETC configuration

6
00:00:18,284 --> 00:00:20,120
Add the 360 image you just uploaded to your library

7
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:24,024
You can also directly upload the 360 image from your computer

8
00:00:24,024 --> 00:00:26,493
Okay, now let's try the first display method: “Screen Overlay”

9
00:00:26,493 --> 00:00:29,763
Set the window size and let's start by placing the “anchor point” at the top left

10
00:00:29,763 --> 00:00:31,898
Now, preview

11
00:00:31,898 --> 00:00:33,299
Click on the hotspot area

12
00:00:33,299 --> 00:00:36,870
You can see the 360 image is at the top left, occupying half of the screen

13
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:43,143
Let's go back and change the “anchor point” to the center

14
00:00:43,143 --> 00:00:45,345
Press Preview again

15
00:00:45,345 --> 00:00:51,651
Now the 360 image is centered

16
00:00:51,651 --> 00:00:54,754
Next, let's try the second display method: “Embed in Block Center”

17
00:00:54,754 --> 00:00:59,726
We resize the hotspot area, and click “Embed in Block Center” on the right

18
00:00:59,726 --> 00:01:01,494
Press Preview

19
00:01:01,494 --> 00:01:03,229
Click on the hotspot area

20
00:01:03,229 --> 00:01:06,366
You can see the 360 image is strictly limited to the hotspot area

21
00:01:06,366 --> 00:01:08,034
This is the “Embed in Block Center” method

22
00:01:08,034 --> 00:01:09,402
Now, let's try the third method: “Preset Display Window”

23
00:01:09,402 --> 00:01:15,141
First, create a new hotspot area and place it on the left

24
00:01:15,141 --> 00:01:17,644
Set it as a “Display Window”

25
00:01:17,644 --> 00:01:20,313
Enter a “Display Window” name

26
00:01:20,313 --> 00:01:25,452
Press to confirm

27
00:01:25,452 --> 00:01:30,290
Select the hotspot area and choose “Preset Display Window”

28
00:01:30,290 --> 00:01:34,661
Select the display window name you just added

29
00:01:34,661 --> 00:01:37,630
Press Preview

30
00:01:37,630 --> 00:01:43,536
The 360 image is shown in the display window you created

31
00:01:43,536 --> 00:01:45,472
Finally, let's try the last display method: “Embed Within Block Area”

32
00:01:45,472 --> 00:01:49,776
Select “Embed Within Block Area” and define the window size and anchor point

33
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:54,314
This operation is similar to the previously mentioned “Screen Overlay”

34
00:01:54,314 --> 00:01:56,883
Press Preview

35
00:01:56,883 --> 00:02:01,621
The difference with 'Screen Overlay' is that the window is only shown within its own block area

36
00:02:01,621 --> 00:02:08,294
Now let's resize and change the “anchor point”

37
00:02:08,294 --> 00:02:10,430
Press Preview

38
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:14,501
You can see the window has changed its position and size, but it still remains within the boundaries of its block
