Add video to Hotspot

2
00:00:00,767 --> 00:00:03,103
First, go to the main menu and click “Media Library”

00:00:20,653 --> 00:00:27,660

Add the video file you just added

9
00:00:32,432 --> 00:00:35,902
You can also directly upload the video from your computer

10
00:00:35,902 --> 00:00:40,106
Okay, now let's try the first display method: “Screen Overlay”

11
00:00:40,106 --> 00:00:44,511
Set the window size and position Let's start by placing the “anchor point” at the top left

12
00:00:44,511 --> 00:00:50,116
Now, preview

13
00:00:50,116 --> 00:00:59,392
You can see the 360 image is on the right, occupying 75% of the screen

14
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:06,199
Let's go back and change to full screen

15
00:01:06,199 --> 00:01:09,135
Click to confirm and Preview

16
00:01:09,135 --> 00:01:15,375
Now you can see when you click the hotspot, the video will play in full screen

17
00:01:15,375 --> 00:01:22,515
Now let’s try the second method: “Embed in block center”

18
00:01:22,515 --> 00:01:28,288
Click to confirm and Preview

19
00:01:28,288 --> 00:01:38,665
You can see the video is strictly limited to the hotspot area

20
00:01:38,665 --> 00:01:43,036
Now, let's try the third method: “Preset Display Window”

21
00:01:43,036 --> 00:01:48,174
First, create a new hotspot area and place it on the left

22
00:01:48,174 --> 00:01:51,811
Set it as a “Display Window”

23
00:01:51,811 --> 00:01:55,582
Enter a name

24
00:01:55,582 --> 00:02:00,153
Select the hotspot area press “Play Video” on left and choose “Preset Display Window“ on right

25
00:02:00,153 --> 00:02:03,456
Select the display window name you just added

26
00:02:03,456 --> 00:02:13,066
The video is shown in the display window you created

27
00:02:13,066 --> 00:02:19,139
Finally, let's try the last display method: “Embed Within Block Area”

28
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:23,977
Select “Embed Within Block Area” and define the window size and anchor point

29
00:02:23,977 --> 00:02:30,683
This operation is similar to the previously mentioned “Screen Overlay”

30
00:02:30,683 --> 00:02:38,024
The difference with 'Screen Overlay' is that the window is only shown within its own block area

31
00:02:38,024 --> 00:02:47,167
Now let's resize and change the “anchor point”

32
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:53,139
You can see the window has changed its position and size, but it still remains within the boundaries of its block
